TDD approach to the Kata @ : https://katalyst.codurance.com/bags
This kata is slightly different from the others: I tryed solving it with TDD and OOP approaches.
I didnt took care of optimizing the code/performances, it's an improvement I will do in the future.
My main concern at the moment is solving taking the right TDD steps, not rushing too fast to the solution, not to slow, step by step.
